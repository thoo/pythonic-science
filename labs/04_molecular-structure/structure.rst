Write a program that:
---------------------

1. Reads a pdb file.
2. Determines the number of protein-protein hydrogen bonds
3. Determines the number of protein-water hydrogen bonds.

You may define a hydrogen bond as a nitrogen/oxygen or oxygen/oyxgen distance less than XX X. 
Your program should run for any pdb file.  

Download the set of pdb files here. 
Create a histogram of protein-protein/protein-water hydrogen bonds.
